# ü¶Ä Rusty RPC
> Trying some *rusty* programming language, to make a *rusty discord rpc*. The main goal with this project is to learn Rust and get to know ü¶Ä **Ferris** and all its secrets.

## üß∂ What is this a Discord RPC
*Discord* RPC (*a.k.a* Discord Rich Presence) is a feature that allows you to display your current activity on *Discord*. It's a way to show what you are doing in a game or application. You can learn more here [*Discord RPC*](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rpc).

This project has been made easier with the help of the wrapper library [*discord-rpc*](https://crates.io/crates/discord-rich-presence) *([git](https://github.com/vionya/discord-rich-presence))* 

# ü™Å How to use
To use this project, you do not need to install anything, just download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/IMXNOOBX/rusty-rpc/releases) and run the executable.

> [!TIP]
> *You can also build it yourself, go to [for developers](#-for-developers)*

## üß© Config
To customize your discord rich presence, you can modify the `config.json` file. 

> [!NOTE]  
> *It will prompt you to generate it once you start it*

        "large_animated_amount": 12, // The amount of frames in the animation
        "large_animated_img": "catgif", // The prefix of the image, the images should be named like this: catgif0, catgif1, catgif2, etc.
